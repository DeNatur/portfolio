# Downsides of using flutter for building websites

Even though flutter web being in stable branch it is still not production ready.
Especially on Firefox scrolling on desktop has still low performence,
images take long to load and whole site needs 3-10 seconds on first boot to load

# TODO

 - Implement contact page,
 
 - Cache Lottie animation and images at loading screen,
 
 - Implement mobile experience page,
 
 - Improve responsivness of experience page,
 
 - Add more detailed description of projects
